        <h3>B. Literature review</h3>
        <p class="start">
          Decision making is a crucial process we engage in every day. The
          choices we make can have a big impact on our lives, affecting our
          well-being and success. This literature review explores decision
          making and its effects by summarizing information from reliable
          sources. One important aspect comes from Kahneman and Tversky's
          Prospect Theory. They found that our decisions are influenced not only
          by expected outcomes but also by how options are presented and our
          perception of gains and losses. Cognitive biases and risk reluctant
          play a role in shaping our choices. Another perspective comes from
          Thaler and Sunstein's book, "Nudge." They discuss how small changes in
          how choices are presented can influence decision making. By
          structuring choices differently, we can help people make better
          decisions without limiting their freedom. This can be applied to areas
          like health, finance, and overall well-being. Emotions also play a
          significant role in decision making, as highlighted by Lerner and
          Keltner. Different emotions can lead to different decision outcomes.
          Positive emotions may make us more prone to taking risks, while
          negative emotions can make us more cautious. Ariely's work in
          "Predictably Irrational" explores the irrational aspects of decision
          making. He provides examples where people's choices don't align with
          traditional economic models of rationality. Social norms, relativity,
          and self-control all influence our decision outcomes. Simon's concept
          of "bounded rationality" challenges the idea of perfect rational
          decision making. He argues that we have limitations in terms of
          information, time, and cognitive capacity. As a result, we often make
          satisfactory choices rather than optimal ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, this review highlights the presence of decision biases,
          the impact of emotions, the influence of choice architecture, and the
          limitations of rational decision making. Understanding these factors
          can empower individuals to make better choices in various areas of
          life.

        <p class="start">
          Meet the members of the team: Mony Leak, Srey Pich, Eng Huy, Thai Hak,
          and Kimsreng, exploring a theme analysis “Decision Making and its
          Impact” from the story “Letters from Thailand”. Mony Leak starts by
          providing insightful background information on the story and describe
          the research objectives, setting the stage for a comprehensive
          exploration of decision-making themes. Mony Leak and Srey Pich conduct
          a very careful literature review to investigate their research,
          formulate relevant research questions, and identify suitable research
          participants. Eng Huy then conducts interviews to gather a faceto-face
          understanding to the analysis with real-life perspectives. Working
          together with Thai Hak, Eng Huy integrate the findings from the
          interview, drawing comparisons with existing analyses and discussions
          on decision-making within the story. To ensure accessibility, Eng Huy
          and Thai Hak make the interview sound files available online in MP3
          format. Lastly, Kimsreng reflects on the team's collaborative journey
          with the challenges, successes, and personal growth experienced
          throughout the project which is me the writer. Together, the team's
          efforts offer a different exploration of decision-making themes in
          "Letters from Thailand", and enhance broader understanding of
          literature, psychology, and decision making. Our team would like to
          express our gratitude to lecturer (Phengheng Khorn) for this
          opportunity to deepen the understanding of what can the story teach
          us. Also thank to our teamwork which is why we can complete this
          assignment.
